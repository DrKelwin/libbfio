Fix
* conversion error for ASCII to UNICODE and vice versa ?
  - currently assumed that the narrow string is UTF-8

Pool
* implement pool throttling on add_handle and set_handle
  - move elements to front of (last used) list on read/write/seek

File
* add errno error strings to liberror notifications
* convert filename for open to UTF-8 or ASCII with codepage
* convert filename for g_open to UTF-8

Memory range
* add callback function to resize memory range if needed?

API
* what about disk full on write errno = ENOSPC

Other

Test
* pool throttling
* chained IO (e.g. OLECF in PST)

Windows
* add WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN or VC_EXTRALEAN to msvscpp

Deployment:
* check macosx
* create debian package
* check if libbfio.3 is up to date
