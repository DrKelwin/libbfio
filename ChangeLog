TODO
* handle clean offset and size on close ?
* complete multi threading support (todo pool)
* remove open on demand ?

Pool
* allow re-set of pool entries?

Memory range
* add callback function to resize memory range if needed?

API
* what about disk full on write

Test
* wide to narrow (ASCII with codepage) conversion
* add autoconf/make test suite
* add open on demand tests
* add multi threading tests
* improve pool tests, e.g. maximum number of open handles
  - add a test for remove handle

Multi-threading support:
* do not add locks to the BFIO back-end IO handles ?

Windows
* add VC_EXTRALEAN to config_msc.h ?
